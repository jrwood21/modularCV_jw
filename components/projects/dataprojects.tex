	Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS): effect on electroence- phalography (EEG) power 
	& NumPy, pandas, MNE-Python, os, matplotlib 
	& Estimate treatment effects on the power spectral density of time series (EEG) data over time, compared to placebo.\\
	\addlinespace
	NIBS: effects on perception \& learning over time 
	& tidyverse (dplyr, tidyr \& ggplot2), lme4, MASS, nnet, broom.mixed, lmtest, boot
	& Estimate treatment effects on a variety of response variables (proportions, counts, response times, time of day, ordinal survey responses) 
	from different distributions (Gaussian, Poisson, inverse Gaussian, von Mises, ordinal logistic) over time, relative to placebo, 
	using linear and generalised linear models. Where applicable, obtain estimates and their confidence intervals on the natural scale via non-parametric bootstrapping. \\
	\addlinespace
	NIBS: effects on motor-evoked potential (MEP) size \& variability over time
	& tidyverse, gamlss, boot 
	& Estimate treatment effects on the mean and within-individual variability of lognormal data (MEP peak-to-peak amplitude) over time, relative to placebo, 
	using a joint model for location \& scale.\\
	\addlinespace
	NIBS: effects on MEP size \& variability over time - model validation 
	& tidyverse, lme4, gamlss, simMetric, broom.mixed, boot 
	& Simulate realistic lognormal experimental data based on exploratory and descriptive analysis of a public dataset. 
	Using these data, validate a joint model to compare changes in the mean and within-individual variability of lognormal data between treatment groups over time.\\
	\addlinespace
	NIBS: effect on rate of change of MEP size over time
	& tidyverse, nlme, boot 
	& Estimate the treatment effect on the rate that a response variable (MEP peak-to-peak amplitude) increases over time towards a maximal plateau, 
	relative to placebo, using a non-linear, one phase exponential association model. \\
	\addlinespace
	Development of interactive learning tasks
	& PsychoPy, NumPy, pandas, os 
	& Execute interactive behavioural learning tasks (associative word learning, sequential finger tapping) that present stimuli to participants and record responses (voice recordings, key presses). 
	This code is available on my \htmltextcol{\href{https://github.com/jrwood21/sleep_tacs_study_jw_gh}{GitHub}}.\\
	\addlinespace
	Shiny web application development
	& tidyverse, Shiny 
	& Create a Shiny (R) app to interactively visualise international powerlifting competition results, using open-source data.\\
