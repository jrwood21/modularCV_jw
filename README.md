# modularCV
I based my CV on [Peter Zhang's template](https://github.com/petezh/Modular-Resume), however, I have modified Peter's template to include:
> - Photo.
> - Right-aligned header text.
> - Tabular input for project summaries.
> - Modified HTML hyperlinks.
> - Increased line spacing and font size.
